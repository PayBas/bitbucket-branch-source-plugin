<div>
    A <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">Java regular expression</a> to
    exclude specific pull request branch names from being affected by the selected naming strategy. Names that match
    the supplied regular expression will not be changed (their original branch names will be used).
    <p>Example: use <code>^release/.*|^hotfix/.*</code> to exclude all <code>release/*</code> and <code>hotfix/*</code>
    branches.<br>Leave empty to apply the selected naming strategy to all pull requests.</p>
    <strong>NOTE:</strong> Pull request discovery strategy classifiers (<code>merge</code> or <code>head</code>) will
    still be appended (or prepended, depending on the naming strategy) if multiple pull request "discovery strategies"
    are active at the same time. Even for branches matching the specified pattern.
