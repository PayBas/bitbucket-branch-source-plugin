    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Any selected strategy will not affect the branch or pull request names on Bitbucket.</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Pull request discovery strategy classifiers (<code>merge</code> or <code>head</code>) will
    still be appended (or prepended, depending on the naming strategy) if multiple pull request "discovery strategies"
    are active at the same time.</p>
    <strong>*</strong> Changing the title of the pull request in Bitbucket will currently cause any previous builds of
    said pull request to be discarded, and a new build branch to be created. It is currently not advised to use this
    strategy if project builds tend to be time consuming.
